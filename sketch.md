## 1. Sketch Toolbox [:link:](http://sketchtoolbox.com)
  Plugin manager for Sketch&mdash;like Homebrew, but for Sketch. [[Direct download]](http://sketchtoolbox.com/Sketch%20Toolbox.zip)

#### Recommended Plugins   
   _Available for install using the Toolbox, just search_

   - **Sketch Iconfont** [:link:](https://github.com/keremciu/sketch-iconfont)   
    _You'll need these [font bundles](https://github.com/keremciu/font-bundles) to start_

   - **Sketch Measure** [:link:](http://utom.design/measure/)   
    _Helpful for sharing specs outside of the Invision inspect mode_
  
   - **Sort Me Sketch** [:link:](https://github.com/romashamin/sort-me-sketch)   
    _ctrl+shift+O or P makes sorting lots of layers very nice_

   - **Sketch Select Similar Layers** [:link:](https://github.com/wonderbit/sketch-select-similar-layers)   
    Super helpful for...selecting similar layers. _Note: this is the plugin by wonderbit._ 
  
   - **Renameit** [:link:](https://github.com/rodi01/RenameIt)   
    Batch renaming layers, because 'Layer Copy 4' doesn't help anyone.
  
   - **Pixel Perfecter** [:link:](https://github.com/swiadek/pixel-perfecter-sketch-plugin)   
    Keep it professional.
    
   - **SVGO Compressor** [:link:](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/svgo-compressor)  
    A nice plugin for the [SVGO tool](https://github.com/svg/svgo) so you don't _have_ to use the command line.

## 2. Craft [:link:](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft)
> Craft is a suite of plugins to let you design with real data in mind.  

That and more&mdash;we use this for our [Invision](https://invisionapp) workflow.

## 3. Miscellaneous Customizations

#### Nice Nudge
Set your large nudge (shift + arrow keys) to 8px (instead of the default 10), makes it easier to work within an 8 point grid. Enter this command into the terminal prompt:
```
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3.plist nudgeDistanceBig -float 8.0
```
_There is a [plugin that does this](http://nudg.it) but I don't see why you'd need to adjust this more than once._
