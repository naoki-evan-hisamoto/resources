# Basic Tools
A list of stuff to install when you're setting up a new laptop


## 1. Git / GitHub [:link:](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
1. [Set up Git and authenticate with GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)  
_N.B. You should have installed Xcode which includes the latest version of Git_




## 2. Homebrew [:link:](http://brew.sh)
_Homebrew is a package manager that makes it easier to install other stuff_  
1. Paste this into a Terminal prompt:    
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

_From the [Treehouse blog](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac):_
> Homebrew is a great tool for web developers. First, it makes removing Node very easy (otherwise you have to crawl through your file system and delete a bunch of files manually). Second, it greatly simplfies the installation of other useful packages like Git, Ruby, or the very useful wget utility.




## 3. Node / NPM [:link:](https://www.npmjs.com)
1. Enter `brew install node` into a Terminal prompt.
2. To check the install, enter `node -v; npm -v`. You should see two numbers print out which are the versions for node and npm respectively.
